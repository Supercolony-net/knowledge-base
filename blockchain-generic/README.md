# Blockchains Primer

## Intro

This page is intended to be a quick reference for main blockchain concepts.

## Sections

// TBD

There should be sections accompanied by the comments, not just links, but links are good

## Crypto/Fiat on/off ramp

This section describes how to get crypto for fiat and fiat for crypto.

## Difference between Bitcoin (currency) and blockchain (it's technology)

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is emitted on per-block basis for validating 
a block (finding the correct hash sum). Only the first miner to validate the block
gets the reward.

Bitcoin's blockchain is a technology that enables secure and pseudo-anonymous transfers
of currency between public keys (accounts).

## What is token/coin?

Coins refer to cryptocurrencies built on their independent blockchain network.
The most famous example is Bitcoin (BTC), which is also the world’s largest
cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Digital coins are designed
to serve the same purpose as physical coins: Transfer of value.

In the meantime, tokens refer to cryptocurrencies that don’t have a blockchain
network of their own. Instead, these cryptocurrencies are built on another blockchain.
Users can create digital tokens using one of the many platforms in the DeFi
(Decentralized Finance) ecosystem.

Much like digital coins, tokens also enable the transfer of value.
However, in most cases, a digital token does have some additional powers than being
a medium of payment. Anyone can create digital tokens to fulfill specific functionalities.

## What does a stablecoin mean?

A stablecoin is a class of cryptocurrencies that attempts
to offer price stability and is backed by a reserve asset.
Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both
worlds: the instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies,
and the volatility-free stable valuations of fiat currencies.

An example of a stablecoin would be Tether USD - USDT. It is backed by the
funds (US dollars) that the founder company possesses. For instance, if some other
company was to buy USDT, they would deposit US dollars to the founder (Tether), and
according amount of USDT would be created (emitted). This way USDT maintains stability.

## What is token economics

Token economics is a new branch of the economy that explains the structure of a 
particular ecosystem in the blockchain sphere. It describes the study, design, and
implementation of economic systems built on blockchain technology. Each platform and
blockchain application is developed under its own token-economics model.

The main features of a well-developed token are:

* utility within the ecosystem
* resistance to inflation
* scalability of usage
* high value
* presence on exchanges
* potential to increase in usage

## What is a node?

[A great article on nodes](https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-what-is-a-node-or-masternode-and-what-does-it-do-4d9a4200938f)

## What's the difference between node & wallet?

A node typically contains full copy of the blockchain locally, while
wallet is a lighter version of the software and acts as a client to broadcast
transactions.

## What is a dApp

A decentralized application (dApp) is an application built on a decentralized
network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface.

## What is Metamask?

Metamask is an interface through which the user is able to create transactions
on Ethereum network and work with smart contracts. Polkadot.js is similar to Metamask,
but interacts with the Polkadot blockchain.

## What is a multisig?

Multisig is a multisignature transaction. This is a type of transaction that requires
signatures (confirmations) of several owners of a particular public key to be created.
This feature is particularly useful for big companies that want to secure their
assets and ensure no separate party is in charge of company's resources.

## What is Polkadot? Why it's unique

Polkadot is a third-generation blockchain technology, which enables maximal scalability
while maintaining security of a decentralized network.

It is unique in that it allows for connection of multiple blockchain with a shared
set of validators, which makes block finalization predictable.

## What is Parity/web3

[Parity](https://www.parity.io) is a company that founded Polkadot, developed 
Substrate. Together with [web3](https://web3.foundation) foundation, they are 
building free and decentralized web. Visit their websites for more information.
