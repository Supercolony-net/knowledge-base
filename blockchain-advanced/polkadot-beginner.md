## Polkadot beginner's guide

### Intro

It's important to understand Polkadot and its infrastructure as a developer.
This article contains suggested resources and order of the discovery of the platform.

### Start

In order to understand Polkadot, you need a good understanding of blockchain
technology in general. You can view that [here](../blockchain-generic/README.md).

### Polkadot basics

[What is polkadot?](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-polkadot-dot)

[Polkadot for dummies](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/polkadot-for-dummies)

After getting a general understanding of what Polkadot, proceed to learning, *how*
does this work.

### Polkadot technical aspects

First, read the introduction to the [wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/getting-started).
This is the main resource a developer can refer to. The documentation is simple, yet
explains practically everything you need to know to develop on Polkadot.

Next, learn the [architecture](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-architecture)
of Polkadot.
The things in 'basics' section are far from basic though, so be sure **NOT TO SKIP**
this whole section. It is the core of Polkadot.

After completing that, proceed to Substrate / Ink.

### Substrate / Ink

It depends on your needs, but it is generally good to know both, at least a little.
Ink works on Substrate, so learning Substrate benefits ink developers, while 
Substrate developers might want to know how smart contracts work when designing
their runtime.

Resources:
* [Substrate KB](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/) 

 It is a good idea to read through docs topics one by one, as well as to complete
[tutorials](https://substrate.dev/en/tutorials)

* [Ink tutorial](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/)

Great practical tutorial for ink!.

* [Substrate recipes](https://substrate.dev/recipes/)

Practical Rust guides to Substrate.
