# Education plan by Igor Belikov
## Technology stack: Rust/Polkadot/Substrate/Ink

----

### The goal of this plan

The main goal of this plan is to quickly get up to speed with the new technology stack and understand it:
* How blockchain works
* What is Polkadot and how it works
* How to create custom blockchain
* What is Smart contract and how it works
* How to expand functionality of blockchain network using Substrate/Ink
* How to communicate with blockchain network using UI
* How to create custom UI for blockchain

----

### Resources which will help reaching the goal

* [Polkadot official website](https://polkadot.network/) and [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/en)
* [Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/en/)
* [Rust programming language learning center](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
* [Building Ink smart contracts tutorial](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/)

----

### 2 weeks studying plan

For the first week the plan is to go through all the [existing Substrate tutorials](https://substrate.dev/en/tutorials) and [building ink smart contract tutorial](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/). Along with the mentioned tutorials I will investigate Rust syntax to get better with programming language. For the second week I am going to go through Rust docs to fill all the left knowledge gaps. I believe that my approach allows me to quickly dive deep in Substrate/Ink blockchain basics and will help me to get ready for the real work building the ready for work solutions.
